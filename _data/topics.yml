- title: Static Semantics
  categories: [front]
  image: /img/scope-graphs/ScopeGraphs.png
  goal: Enable language designers to declaratively specify the name binding and typing rules of programming languages and automatically derive (efficient and incremental) type checkers from such specifications. Develop high-level model for representation of name binding rules and operations such as name resolution and refactoring, depending on name binding.
  techniques: name binding and resolution with scope graphs, constraints, constraint solving.
  languages: Statix, <a href="http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/nabl2/index.html">NaBL2</a>, NaBL.

- title: Dynamic Semantics
  categories: [front]
  image:
  goal: Identify the building blocks of the dynamic semantics of programming languages to create a specification language that can be used to concisely define a wide range of languages, derive efficient execution engines, and serve as the basis for automatic type soundness proofs.
  techniques: operational semantics, definitional interpreters, abstract machines, partial evaluation, intrinsically-typed abstract syntax, scopes and frames.
  languages: Dynamix, <a href="http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/dynsem/index.html">DynSem</a>.
  # that can be used to derive high-performance execution engines as well as support automatic type soundness prooofs.  Design a language for the high-level specification of dynamic semantics. DynSem;  partial evaluation; scopes-and-frames; automating type soundness proofs
