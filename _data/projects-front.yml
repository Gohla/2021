- title: Compiler Construction
  link: /#researchtopics
  text: "<p>Compilers translate the source code of programs in a high-level programming language into executable (virtual) machine code. Nowadays, compilers are typically integrated into development environments providing features like syntax highlighting, content assistance, live error reporting, and continuous target code generation.</p> <p> This course studies the architecture of compilers and interactive programming environments and the concepts and techniques underlying the components of that architecture. For each of the components of a compiler we study the formal theory underlying the language aspect that it covers, declarative specification languages to define compiler components, and the techniques for their implementation. The concepts and techniques are illustrated by application to small languages or language fragments.</p><p>The compiler construction program consists of two courses of 5 ECTS each.</p>"

  text: "The <a href=http://spoofax.dev>Spoofax Language Workbench</a> is an environment for the development of programming languages using high-level declarative meta-languages for syntax, static semantics, dynamic semantics, program analysis, and program transformation. We use Spoofax to implement a compiler and IDE for the project language and in homework assignments to experiment with various aspects of compilers in isolation."

- title: "ChocoPy: Project Language"
  link: https://chocopy.org/
  text: "In the course project students implement a compiler for <a href=https://chocopy.org/>ChocoPy</a>, a subset of Python3 with static types. The back-end of the compiler generates RISC-V code, which can be run with a simulator running on the JVM. The language comes with a <a href=https://chocopy.org/chocopy_language_reference.pdf>fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics</a>. ChocoPy was developed at UC Berkeley for their compiler course."

  link: https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2020-2021/
  text: "We use the WebLab learning management system for homework assignments. In WebLab you can submit answers to exercises with grammars, type systems, and transformations, which we can automatically grade. You can even program the solutions directly in WebLab, but it is probably more convenient at this stage to do that in Spoofax and then copy the solutions. We will also use WebLab for the (online) digital exams for the course. Thus, you will be expected to program in the Spoofax meta-languages at the exam."
