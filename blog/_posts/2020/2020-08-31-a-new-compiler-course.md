We're changing things this year.
Of course, due to Corona the course takes place mostly online.
But we're also changing things to the contents of the course.

* The course used to be split in a theory part and a practical part. This year, we have split the course in a front-end part (CS4200-A) in Q1 and a back-end part (CS4200-B) in Q2. Each course includes theory and practice of that part of the compiler. So the complete course is still 10 ECTS.

* We're introducing a new website.

* Most documentation is on the [MetaBorg](http://metaborg.org) website.

* The project changes from MiniJava, a Java subset, to ChocoPy, a Python subset.

* There will be less emphasis in the project on testing.

* We will not provide a template project (for the front-end course). You set up the language project in Spoofax from scratch.

* We will have programming exercises in WebLab.
