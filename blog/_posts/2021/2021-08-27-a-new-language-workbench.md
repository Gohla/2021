This year will adopt last year's structure of the course, and slightly adapt it.
In particular, we will keep the ChocoPy project.
Major changes to the course are

- We introduce [Spoofax 3](https://www.spoofax.dev/spoofax-pie/develop/) (aka Spoofax-PIE), a redesign of the guts of the workbench recombining the familiar meta languages.

- We introduce a new website for the Spoofax meta languages at <https://www.spoofax.dev/>

- For the back-end of the compiler (that you develop in Q2) we adopt the nanopass compiler architecture approach.

- We introduce Stratego 2, a [gradually typed](https://researchr.org/publication/SmitsV20) version of the Stratego transformation language.
