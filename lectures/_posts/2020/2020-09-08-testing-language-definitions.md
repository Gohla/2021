In this hands-on tutorial we demonstrated testing syntax definitions with the SPT testing languages.
For more information on SPT, see the cited OOPSLA'11 paper, the [SPT documentation](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/spt/index.html), and [Lab 1(b)](/project/2020/09/08/lab1b/).
The recording of the tutorial is available on Brightspace.
