In the opening lecture we look at what compilers are, why you would want to study them, and how the course is organized.

### Reading Material

The lecture discusses the traditional compiler pipeline. In the course we will be using the Spoofax language workbench to define and implement languages. The [OOPSLA 2010] paper describes the design of Spoofax. The [SEFM 2020] paper gives an overview of SDF3, the language we will for syntax definition.
