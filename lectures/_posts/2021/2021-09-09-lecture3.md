In this lecture we study the declarative disambiguation of [declarative syntax definitions](/2021/lecture/2) using associativity and priority rules.
As a prelimary to understanding disambiguation, we first study the semantics of context-free grammars in terms of sentence and tree derivation.
We discuss the semantics of such rules in terms of subtree exclusion and how (simple) disambiguations can be expressed by means of grammar transformation.

We end with a discussion of disambiguation using layout constraints, in order to express layout-sensitive syntax.
