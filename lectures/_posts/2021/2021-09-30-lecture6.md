In this lecture we study the semantics and implementation of type checking with constraints.
We study the declarative semantics of constraints by means of constraint satisfaction: given a model (solution), does is the constraint satisfied under that model?
And we study the implementation of constraint solvers as a rewrite system that simplifies constraints to basic unification, scope graph, and name resolution constraints.
Finally, we study unification, its properties, a naive algorithm, and efficient implementation using union-find.

The [PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/2021/06-solving-constraints/CS4200-2021-6-solving-constraints-builds.pdf) of the slides with builds are useful for the union-find section.
