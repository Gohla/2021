In this lecture we study declarative syntax definition.

### Reading Material

The [SEFM 2020] paper gives an overview of SDF3, the language we will use for syntax definition.

The [LDTA 2012] paper introduced 'template-based syntax definition'. (This was one of the results of the master's thesis work of Tobi Vollebregt.)

### Tutorial and Talk on SDF3
