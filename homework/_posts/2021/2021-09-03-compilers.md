The assignments for [Lecture 1]({{site.baseurl}}/lecture/1) are essay questions, which you can find on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2021-2022/assignment/87591/info).
We will _not_ grade these assignments, and they are not part of the Homework grade.
But expect these types of questions on the exam.
