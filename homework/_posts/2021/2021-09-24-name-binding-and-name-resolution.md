In this set of assignments, published on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2020-2021/assignment/51095/view), we exercise the definition of name resolution in Statix following the material of [Lecture 5](/lecture/5).

You can make the assignments directly in WebLab, but we recommend following the [instructions](/homework/2020/09/17/homework-project/) to set up a Spoofax project to make the assignments in Spoofax.

The template for the assignments this week is: given this language (the syntax definition of which you can find in the 'test data' of the assignment) define the given predicate (e.g. `typeOfExp`) for all the constructs of the language such that all tests succeed. The assignment text gives a high-level explanation of the expected properties of operators. The tests provide concrete examples.
