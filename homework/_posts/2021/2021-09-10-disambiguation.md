In this set of assignments, published on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2021-2022/assignment/87683/view), we exercise the disambiguation of grammars following the material of [Lecture 3]({{site.baseurl}}/lecture/3).

You can make the assignments directly in WebLab, but we recommend following the [instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/homework/1-1-b) to set up a Spoofax project to make the assignments in Spoofax.

The template for the assignments this week is: given this (ambiguous) context-free grammar:

- Show that the grammar is indeed ambiguous by giving a sentence and at least two different left-most derivations for that sentence and the corresponding abstract syntax trees.

- Disambiguate the grammar using declarative disambiguation rules to indicate the associativity and priority of operators.

- Transform the grammar to an unambiguous grammar with equivalent abstract syntax trees for sentences.

We also provide an assignment to exercise disambiguation using layout constraints.
