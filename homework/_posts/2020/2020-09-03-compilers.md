The assignments for [Lecture 1](/lectures/2020/09/03/introduction/) are essay questions, which you can find on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2020-2021/assignment/49295/view).
We will _not_ grade these assignments, and they are not part of the Homework grade.
But expect these types of questions on the exam.
