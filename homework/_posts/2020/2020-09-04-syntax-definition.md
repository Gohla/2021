In this set of assignments, published on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2020-2021/assignment/51091/view), we exercise syntax definition in SDF3 to define the structure and notation of programs following the material of [Lecture 2](/lectures/2020/09/04/declarative-syntax-definition/).

You can make the assignments directly in WebLab, but we recommend following the [instructions](/homework/2020/09/04/homework-project) to set up a Spoofax project to make the assignments in Spoofax.
