In this set of assignments, published on [WebLab](https://weblab.tudelft.nl/cs4200/2020-2021/assignment/51091/view), we exercise syntax definition in SDF3 to define the structure and notation of programs following the material of [Lecture 2](/lectures/2020/09/04/declarative-syntax-definition/).

You can make the assignments directly in WebLab, but we recommend following the [instructions](/homework/2020/09/04/homework-project) to set up a Spoofax project to make the assignments in Spoofax.

The template for the assignments this week is: given this (fragment of a) language, provide a syntax definition for it.
We give a couple of examples.
In the exam we will test your skills in this department.
So, do exercise your understanding of syntax definition by creating syntax definitions for all the languages you encounter.
