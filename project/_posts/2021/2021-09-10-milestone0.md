In this milestone we test that your GitLab set-up works.

### Objective

Testing that your GitLab repository works with our automatic grading set-up.

Your repository should consist of (at least) the following:

1. A Spoofax project located in either the `chocopy.syntax` (preferred) or `chocopy` subfolder of your repository
1. The project should contain at least one example.
1. The project should contain at least one test.
1. Your language project builds.
1. Your language project parses a program consisting of just `1`.

### Submission

You need to submit your ChocoPy project with a merge request on GitLab.
The [Git and submission documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/lab/1d#submitting-a-milestone) explains how to file such a request.

The deadline for submission is September 10 2021, 23:59.
