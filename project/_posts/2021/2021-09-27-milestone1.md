In this milestone you submit your syntax definition.

### Submission

You need to submit your ChocoPy project with a merge request on GitLab.
The [Git and Submissions documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/lab/1d) explains how to file such a request.

The deadline for submission is September 26 2020, 23:59.

### Grading

We grade your submission based on compliance with the ChocoPy syntax as defined in the reference manual, taking into account:

* lexical syntax
* context-free syntax
* disambiguation
  * associativity
  * precedence
* layout constraints

### Early Feedback

We provide early feedback for the correctness of your syntax definition.
This feedback gives you an indication which parts of your syntax definition might still be wrong.
It includes a summary on how many tests you pass and how many points you earn by passing them.
You have **15** early feedback attempts.

Note that we will grade the functionality of your parser using SPT tests.
This will earn you at most a 7.
In addition we will grade your syntax definition manually look for idiomatic syntax definition using disambiguation rules and layout constraints.

<!-- #### Please use the new parser

We highly recommend you use the new layout-sensitive parser. Make sure to use the layout-sensitive variant and to update Spoofax.

If your project does not use it, there is a chance that you will fail certain tests for the early feedback/grading pipeline.

This new parser fixes a couple of bugs dealing with layout constraints not being properly recognized, and non-associative productions not producing an error. If you have written any tests for these yourself, you might need to update them. -->
