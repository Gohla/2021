For the course project and for some of the homework assignments we will use the [Spoofax Language Workbench](https://www.spoofax.dev) version [Spoofax 3](https://www.spoofax.dev/spoofax-pie/develop/).

### Installing Spoofax

Follow the [tutorial](https://www.spoofax.dev/spoofax-pie/develop/tutorial/install/) on installing Spoofax3.

### Language Projects

In Spoofax you develop a programming language in a 'language project'.

Follow the tutorial on [Creating a language project](https://www.spoofax.dev/spoofax-pie/develop/tutorial/create_language_project/) to create a project with syntax and syntax tests.

### ChocoPy Project

Create a Spoofax project for the ChocoPy language.
