In this lab, you define the static analysis of ChocoPy in Spoofax.
Follow the instructions from [Lab 1(a)]({{site.baseurl}}/lab/1a/) for using Spoofax.

#### Modifying the Static Analysis

Static analysis is implement in the Statix language of Spoofax.
The `/src/main.stx` file is the main Statix file.
You can define static analysis rules in this main file, but it is probably a good idea to distribute your Statix definition over multiple modules, as Statix is a modular language.
If you create new modules, you must import them into `/src/main.stx`.
