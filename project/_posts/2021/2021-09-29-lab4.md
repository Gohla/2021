In this lab, follow [Lecture 5]({{site.baseurl}}/lecture/5) and the homework assignments for [Week 4]({{site.baseurl}}/homework/4) to extend the type checking predicates with name resolution.

Continue your study of Section 4 of the [ChocoPy Reference Manual]({{site.baseurl}}/labl/0a) with the type rules of the language.

Start with the definition of local variable declarations and variable references in this first lab. Next add formal parameters of functions.

Define test cases to validate your definition. Make sure to test for shadowing of variables. Did you implement the correct visibility policy in your resolution queries.
