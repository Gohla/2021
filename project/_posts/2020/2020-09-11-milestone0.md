1. A project `chocopy.syntax.example`
1. A project `chocopy.syntax.test`
1. Your language project builds
1. Your language project uses `Program` as start symbol
1. Your language project parses a program consisting of just `1`

### Submission

You need to submit your ChocoPy project with a merge request on GitLab.
