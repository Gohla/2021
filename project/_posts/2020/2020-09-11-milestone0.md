In this milestone we test that your GitLab set-up works.

### Objective

Testing that your GitLab repository works with our automatic grading set-up.

Your repository should consist of (at least) the following:

1. A project `chocopy.syntax`
1. A project `chocopy.syntax.example`
1. A project `chocopy.syntax.test`
1. Your language project builds
1. Your language project uses `Program` as start symbol
1. Your language project parses a program consisting of just `1`

### Submission

You need to submit your ChocoPy project with a merge request on GitLab.
The [Git and submission documentation](/project/2020/09/08/submissions/#submitting-a-milestone) explains how to file such a request.

The deadline for submission is September 11 2020, 23:59.
