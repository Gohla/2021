In this lab you extend the syntax definition of the previous lab with disambiguation rules and layout constraints in order to ensure that the syntax definition is unambiguous.

### Objectives

Extend the syntax definition that you developed in the previous lab with

1. Disambiguation rules
2. Layout constraints to

### Disambiguation Rules

You need disambiguation constructs to disambiguate your syntax definition.
You can specify the associativity with attributes `left`, `right`, or `non-assoc` (See [documentation](http://www.metaborg.org/en/latest/source/langdev/meta/lang/sdf3/reference.html#attributes)).
These attributes are added to the end of a rule:

```
context-free syntax
  Exp.Constr1 = ... {left}
```

You can specify precedence in a `context-free priorities` section.
In this section, you order groups of rules:

```
context-free priorities
  {
    Exp.Constr1
    Exp.Constr2
  } > { ... } > ...
```

You can also define the associativity of a group:

```
context-free priorities
  { left:
    Exp.Constr1
    Exp.Constr2
  } > { ... } > ...    
```
Finally you should also consider specifying a `bracket` rule for disambiguation of expressions.
