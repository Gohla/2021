In this milestone you submit your syntax definition.

### Submission

You need to submit your ChocoPy project with a merge request on GitLab.
The [Git documentation](/documentation/git.html#submitting-an-assignment) explains how to file such a request.

The deadline for submission is September 27 2019, 23:59.

### Grading

We grade your submission based on compliance with the ChocoPy syntax as defined in the reference manual, taking into account:

* lexical syntax
* context-free syntax
* disambiguation
  * associativity
  * precedence
* layout constraints

### Early Feedback

We provide early feedback for the correctness of your syntax definition.
This feedback gives you an indication which parts of your syntax definition might still be wrong.
It includes a summary on how many tests you pass and how many points you earn by passing them.
You have 6 early feedback attempts.
