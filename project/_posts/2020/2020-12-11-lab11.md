In this lab you develop code generation for statements and extend your implementation of functions to deal with nested functions.

See the slides of [Lecture 14](/lecture/14) for a discussion of static links and several critical example ChocoPy programs.

### Objectives

1. Compiling statements

2. Compiling string constants

3. Execution environment

3. Compiling nested functions

4. Challenges

### Compiling Statements

### String Constants

### Execution Environment

### Compiling Nested Functions

#### Shadowing

In ChocoPy definitions can shadow (make invisible) the definition of other names.
You will have encountered this in your definition of a 

```
a : int = 10
def foo(a: int) !- int:
 def foo(b : int) !- int:
 a : int = 20
 return a + b
 return foo(a + 10)

print(foo(a))
```



#### Evaluation Order

A question to consider when compiling function calls is whether the order of evaluation of function arguments is relevant.
For a language such as C, the order of evaluation is not defined, and up to the compiler to chose an order.
This means that programmers cannot count on the order being deterministic.
Is the order of evaluation of function call arguments defined for ChocoPy?
Does that correspond to the semantics of Python?

### Challenges

#### Functions as First-Class Citizens

Functions in ChocoPy can be nested. This means that they can have 'free variables' that are defined in the context of the function definitions.
But ChocoPy functions are not first-class citizens.
Thus, one cannot pass a function to another function or store it in a data structure.
Can you extend ChocoPy with functions as first-class citizens, i.e. add anonymous function literals to the language?
What syntax would you give to such function literals?
What would be your strategy for implementing this feature?
