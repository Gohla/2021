We use the Git version control system with https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl to manage submissions and grade assignments. You can access EWI GitLab with you NetID.

Did you already register for EWI GitLab (before 2019), but with a different username than your NetID? We need to change it to prevent issues with single sign-on.

To setup your individual repository, we need to know your NetID. Please provide it in your answer to this question on WebLab. If your GitLab username is different than your NetID, provide it in your answer too. We will then update your GitLab username.

If you are in doubt about your answer, check the model answer by clicking the A button in the top right corner.
